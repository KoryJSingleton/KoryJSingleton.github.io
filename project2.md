## Project description

In this program, I aimed to create a simple hypotenuse calculator. In essence, it presents as a fairly simple mathematical function, however, it shows a solid foundational understanding of the perl programming language and associated math functionality.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
perl Project2.prl
```

## UI Design

The program is intended to be run from the terminal on your computer, although it should function normally on any proper compiler or code editors. Upon startup, the program will ask the user for a number (representing one non-hypotenuse side), which the user can input and then confirm, by pressing the enter key. This process is then repeated for the second side of the triangle. From there, the program will calculate and output the hypotenuse for the triangle.
