-   **Source Code Repository:** [features/mastering-markdown](https://github.com/KoryJSingleton/Sort-Time-Analyzer)  
    (Please [email me](mailto:example@KorySingleton35@gmail.com?subject=GitHub%20Access) to request access.)

## Project description

In this program, I seek to compile and display sort times from 3 different sorting algorithmns (bubble, quick and mergesort). To do so, the program, upon startup, constrcuts a number of arrays and singly-linked lists to be sorted. The amount of time needed for each program is tracked and then placed into a .csv file, which is created in the same repository as the rest of the program. From there, I took the data from the .csv and made it into a graph to make the difference in time more easily viewable for the reader, however, this part of the function isn't done by the source code.

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

```bash
cd ./lab11
make run
```

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

There is very little user input. All that the user is required to do is 'cd' into the correct directory and then run the program  usssing 'make run'.

## 3. Additional Considerations
