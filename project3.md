-   **Class: CSCI 431**

-   **Source Code Repository:** [Sudoku-Threader Repository](https://github.com/KoryJSingleton/Sudoku-Threader-Program)

## Project description

This program sought to design code capable of distinguishing if a given sudoku table was valid as a solution (that is to say, it contains only one instance of a number per row, one instance of a number per column and 1 instance of each number 1-9 within a 3x3 square).

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

gcc -Wall -Wextra -02 -pthread sudoku-threader.c -o sudoku-threader

./sudoku-threader


## UI Design

There are no real UI elements within the code. When the executable is run, it functions on its own.

## 3. Additional Considerations

While the program operates off of a static sudoku puzzle, it can be edited within the .c file to test for different solutions.
