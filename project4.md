## Project description

This was a project where I had to work on constructing a .TeX file while displaying the ability to properly code a B-tree and maintain understanding of the processes required to add or delete nodes from it.

## No compilation necessary for project

Running is not necessary for this project. A pdf is included while displays the final result, as the code is intended to be static so different runs wont create alternative versions.


## UI Design

There is no UI for this.
