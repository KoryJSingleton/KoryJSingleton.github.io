## Project description

This is an a timed coding exam that was administered as a midterm-level assessment. Its inclusion in this project is to show off my ability to be given a product of code, and accurately debug and code solutions to partially completed code bases in limited amounts of time (each question was given 35 minutes or less).

## How to compile and run the program

How to compile (if applicable) and run the project.

~~~bash
cd project4
cd exam1-1(or the corresponding question)
make

If the programming language does not require compilation, the update the heading to be “How to run the program.” If your application is deployed on a remote service, including instructions on how to deploy it.

## UI Design

There is no UI for this. It simply stands as a tesatmment to the level of coding I was able to surmount to at the time of my midterm.

## 3. Additional Considerations

These problems were to be answered within a 25-35 min timespan wherein the student could not see the code before beginning the problem.
